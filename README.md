# The Therapy Calculator

Hey there! This is a project that attempts to de-mystify how much it costs to see a therapist for a year. Major topics covered include:

- Whether you may qualify for a sliding scale fee based on your income
- Whether any health insurance you may have is helpful
- Whether you can take advantage of any tax deductions

The calculator walks you through each topic, and based on your selections it tries to determine:
- How much you'll pay over the course of a year
- How much each session costs averaged over that year

## Tools used
Not much! All of the calculations are done in javascript, with jQuery. Other tools used:

- Form elements, submissions and validations use Zurb's Foundation 6 library
- There's a progress bar based on [NProgress](https://github.com/rstacruz/nprogress) and [onScreen](https://github.com/silvestreh/onScreen)
- CSS uses Sass

## How to contribute
Check my math and make sure I'm not doing anything goofy! Also, here's a list of issues I'd still like to work on:

- Add the ability to change how often you see your therapist
- What happens if someone's insurance covers costs completely? Does this ever happen?
- What happens if someone has an MSA?
- What happens if someone has Medicare or Medicaid?
- What happens if someone has a yearly out-of-pocket limit?
- ~~Different tax calculations based on whether you're the head of household or filing jointly~~ DONE
- Add an option to fill it out with sample numbers

Other ideas welcome!
