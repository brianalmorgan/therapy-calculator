        <h1>How much can I expect to pay for therapy?</h1>
        <p class="subhead">*in 2017 America</p>
        <p>Hey there! I know the idea of budgeting for therapist is stressful, but it might not cost as much as you think! I'll try to get you some answers. First: how much money does your household make in a year?</p>
        <input type="text" id="income-field">
        <p class="helper">I'm not going to share it with anyone, don't worry. I just need to do some math. But you can also <a href="">see a demo</a> with sample numbers.</p>

    <!-- Your per session rate -->
    <section>
      <div id="sliding-scale-div"></div>
      <p>I'll estimate that each session might cost <span class="strong" id="baserate-span"></span>.</p>
      <p>-----slider----</p>
      <p>If you see your therapist once a week, that's <span class="strong" id="yearly-cost-span"></span> over the course of a year.</p>
      <p>But don't worry just yet&mdash;let's see if we can lower that. Do you have health insurance? Some therapists don't accept it, but you may still be able to get some money.</p>
      <button class="next-step" id="step-two-yes">Yes, let's check</button>
      <button class="next-step" id="step-two-no">Nope, no insurance</button>

    <!-- Getting your health insurance -->
    <section>
      <h2>Great!</h2>
      <p>This is the only tricky part: you'll need to check the details of your plan for your mental health benefits. You might be able to find this out by logging into your plan online, but you can also call your insurance's help line. They'll explain what they cover. Ask them:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Whether therapy delivered in an office setting is covered by your plan</li>
        <li>If so, what is your <strong>copayment</strong> for an in-network provider</li>
        <li>What is the <strong>coinsurance rate</strong> for an out-of-network provider</li>
        <li>What is your current <strong>deductible</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>When you're ready, let's walk through the options:</p>
      <p>---therapy is covered or not----</p>
      <p>---therapist is in network or not----</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Getting your in-network benefits -->
    <section>
      <h2>Nice!</h2>
      <p>Let's apply your insurance and see if that lowers your costs. What's your copay?</p>
      <input type="text" id="copay-field" value="40">
      <p>If you have a deductible, enter it here:</p>
      <input type="text" id="deductible-field-innetwork">
      <p class="helper">You can enter your yearly deducible, or if your deductible is pretty high and you don't typically reach it in a year, enter the amount you don't use up.</p>
      <button class="next-step" id="">Apply it!</button>
    </section>

    <!-- Getting your out-of-network benefits -->
    <section>
      <h2>Not a problem</h2>
      <p>Let's see if the coverage you have will be helpful. I entered some example amounts here for you, but you should adjust them.</p>
      <p>Deductible:</p>
      <input type="text" id="deductible-field-outofnetwork" value="500">
      <p class="helper">You can enter your yearly deducible, or if your deductible is pretty high and you don't typically reach it in a year, enter the amount you don't use up.</p>
      <p>Coinsurance Rate:</p>
      <p class="helper">Enter the percentage you are responsible for. For example, after you hit your deductible your insurance may cover 70% of your costs, so your coinsurance is 30%</p>
      <input type="text" id="coinsurance-field" value="30">
      <button class="next-step" id="step-three">Looks good!</button>
    </section>

    <!-- Applying your health insurance -->
    <section>
      <p>OK! That brought your cost down to <span class="strong" id="insurance-yearly-span"></span> per year, or about <span class="strong" id="insurance-baserate-span"></span> per session averaged out. Less scary, right?</p>
      <p>One more thing to check: are you elligible for a Flexible Spending Account through your job?</p>
      <button class="next-step" id="step-four-yes">Yes</button>
      <button class="next-step" id="step-four-no">No</button>
    </section>

    <!-- Getting your FSA contribution -->
    <section>
      <p>Cool. Let's assume you can put $<input id="fsa-field" value=""></span> in your FSA, and see how much that lowers your costs.</p>
      <button class="next-step" id="step-five-yes">Check it out</button>
      <button class="next-step" id="step-five-no">Skip it</button>
    </section>

    <!-- Applying your FSA contribution -->
    <section>
      <p>Guess what? You just saved <span id="tax-discount-span"></span> on your taxes.</p>
      <button class="next-step" id="final-step">Here's your final summary:</button>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Your session rate: <span id="final-session-rate"></span></p>
      <p>A year of therapy might cost you <span id="final-yearly-cost"></span>, but you'll have saved <span id="insurance-saved"></span> by using your insurance and <span id="taxes-saved"></span> on your taxes by using your FSA.</p>
